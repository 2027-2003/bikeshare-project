# Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The goal is to explore US bikeshare data to understand usage patterns in different cities.

## 📊 Data Used

The data comes from three major US cities:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington

Each dataset contains information about individual trips made in the bike-sharing system.

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Time module

## 📂 Project Files

- bikeshare.py: The main Python script used to perform the analysis.
- .gitignore: Ensures that .csv data files are not pushed to GitHub.
- GIT_COMMANDS.md: Documentation of all Git/GitHub commands used during the project.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Run the bikeshare.py script.
2. Follow the terminal prompts to filter data by city, month, or day.
3. The program will compute and display descriptive statistics based on the user's input.
